## Hardware required

* Raspberry Pi 3A+/3B/3B+/Zero W
* SD Card
* Power supply
* 3.5mm audio cable to the input on your speakers/Hi-Fi (usually 3.5mm or RCA) OR USB based speaker

**Note:** the Raspberry Pi Zero cannot be used on it's own as it has no audio output. To use the Pi Zero you'll need to add something like the [Pimoroni pHAT DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/phat-dac) to go with it.

## Software required

* A download of this project (of course)
* Software to flash an SD card

## Setup and use

Simply flash the image to an SD card and put it on your Raspberry Pi.
The video stream from your camera can be accessed by reaching to the device's IP address.
